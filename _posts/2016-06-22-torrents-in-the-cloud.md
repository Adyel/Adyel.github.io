***Disclaimer:** I made this blog post so I could have more FREE storage with Seedr.cc, I recommend you do the same.*

Today I was browsing the interweb looking for a better way to download torrents. I wanted a way to safely download torrents but I also wanted something that wouldn't use up all my computer's bandwidth. I've heard of [seedboxes](https://www.reddit.com/r/seedboxes/) before but all of them seemed to cost more than Netflix for minimal storage and speed. In light of things I found something a little different than your average seedbox: [Seedr.cc](https://seedr.cc)

# Background
The idea behind Seedr.cc is very similar to that of a seedbox, but it takes away the sometimes difficult learning curve and the absurd paywalls. Seeedr.cc gives you a free 2gb of torrent storage and has very cheap upgrade options ($6.95 for 30GB). The company refers to themselves as a torrent client in the cloud, which is totally true, and at the moment I am currently using Seedr.cc in replacement of my lame desktop client.

# Why is this Better?
What really sets Seedr.cc apart from your average desktop torrent client is that it doesn't hog all your computer's data and the interface is much nicer, in my opinion. The user experience is very intuitive and pleasing. Regristration is as simple and once you get to the minimal web interface all you have to do is copy and paste the torrent link. Download speeds aren't anything special, but that's to be expected at the price.

# Conclusion
What Seedr.cc offers is a secure cloud client for your torrenting habits all for the low price of free. And if you want extra storage it's very affordable compared to other seedboxes. With the push to cloud based everything being so popular right now it only seems right that torrents would too. I have switched from desktop torrenting to the cloud based alternative for the same reason I ditched my dvds for Netflix and cds for Spotify, ease of use and a simple interface.
